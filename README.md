# website-blocker
Blocks websites of choice during work hours for increased productivity

State your work hours and websites you want to avoid during that time to ensure they are blocked and don't cause any distractions!

To put this blocker into effect, go to Task Scheduler and create a task that starts the Blocker.pyw file at system startup.
